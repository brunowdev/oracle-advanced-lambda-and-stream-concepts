## Lesson 1: Lambda Expressions

This week covers the new lambda expressions feature added to Java SE 8. The lessons cover:

Why lambda expressions are needed in Java.
Why this feature was added to Java after twenty years.
The syntax of lambda expressions.
How to use lambda expressions and the rules that govern their use.
Examples of classes and methods that use lambda expressions like the new removeIf and replaceAll methods in the Collections API.
We provide video instruction along with written tutorials that guide you through the process. Please watch each video carefully to ensure that  you have your system properly set up to complete this lesson.  The videos and tutorials are listed sequentially, and we recommend that you use the instructional materials in that order.

As you progress through the materials, you will notice that the Oracle Learning Library adds a green check mark next to each item that you have accessed (You must be logged in). This helps you track your progress. Don't hesitate to ask a question in the forum if you hit a snag.


## Lesson 2: Introduction to the Streams API

In lesson 2 you will learn how to use the new Streams API to apply functional programming techniques in Java. You will learn to:

Use functional programming concepts.
Define streams and stream pipelines in Java.
Create object streams and primitive streams.
Create streams using Java classes.
Use intermediate operations in a stream pipeline.
Use terminal operations in a stream pipeline.
Use the Optional class to handle null values.
Homework is linked in the Supporting Materials section.

## Lesson 3: Advanced Lambda and Stream Concepts

In lesson 3 you will learn advance stream concepts like reduction and collection. You will learn to:

Perform a reduction using streams.
Create and use finite and infinite streams in Java.
Avoid the use of forEach.
Save items from from a stream using the Collectors class and the collect method.
Use parallel stream and also learn when not to.
